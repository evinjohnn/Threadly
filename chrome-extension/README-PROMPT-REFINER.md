## Platform-Specific Optimizations

### ChatGPT Optimization
- **Clear Instructions**: Direct, specific commands
- **Role Assignment**: "Act as a [expert/teacher/developer]"
- **Tone Specification**: Formal, friendly, technical, etc.
- **Output Format**: Lists, step-by-step, specific structures

**Example:**
```
Original: "help me with python"
Refined: "Act as a senior Python developer. Provide a comprehensive guide for Python programming, including best practices, common patterns, and practical examples. Use a friendly, educational tone and include code snippets with explanations."
```

### Claude Optimization
- **XML Structure**: Uses `<instruction>`, `<context>`, `<task>` tags
- **System Prompts**: Clear role and behavior definitions
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Includes examples when beneficial
- **Chain of Thought**: Encourages step-by-step reasoning

**Example:**
```
Original: "write a story"
Refined: "<system>You are a creative writing coach specializing in short stories.</system>
<instruction>Write an engaging short story</instruction>
<context>Target audience: general readers, length: 500-800 words</context>
<task>Create a compelling narrative with well-developed characters and a satisfying conclusion</task>"
```

### Gemini Optimization
- **Explicit Instructions**: Clear task definitions
- **Rich Context**: Detailed background information
- **Output Specifications**: Format and style requirements
- **Conversational Tone**: Natural, engaging language

**Example:**
```
Original: "explain machine learning"
Refined: "Task: Explain machine learning concepts in simple terms
Context: The explanation is for beginners with no technical background
Output Format: Use analogies and real-world examples, structure with clear headings
Requirements: Cover supervised vs unsupervised learning, include practical applications"
```

### Perplexity Optimization
- **Clear Instructions**: Specific, actionable requests
- **Data Sources**: Requests credible sources and citations
- **Background Context**: Relevant information for better responses
- **Follow-up Questions**: Suggests deeper exploration

**Example:**
```
Original: "climate change facts"
Refined: "Instruction: Provide recent, data-backed facts about climate change
Context: Focus on scientific consensus and recent research findings
Input: Include statistics from peer-reviewed studies and official reports
Output Format: Present key facts with sources and dates
Follow-up: Suggest areas for deeper investigation"
```
